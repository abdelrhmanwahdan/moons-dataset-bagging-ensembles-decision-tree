# moons dataset bagging ensembles decision tree
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the moons dataset then after that I am doing classification on it using bagging ensembles decision tree by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Using bagging ensembles on many decision trees to do classification.
